# Excel-Spreadsheet-for-Cumulative-Prospect-Theory-Application
This was a spreadsheet that we used (originally developed by Dr. Inchul Yang) to test out how to compute the CPT values for the choices in the paper below: Chow, J.Y.J., Lee, G., Yang, I., 2010. Genetic algorithm to estimate cumulative prospect theory parameters for selection of high-occupancy-vehicle lane. Transportation Research Record 2157, 71-77. There are 3 tabs: the first tab is the CPT calculator, second is the training data extracted from NGSIM, and third is the NGSIM data allocated for validation. To use the CPT calculator, just copy and paste any one of the lines in the training/validation tabs to replace the line 4 in the calculator. This was customized to evaluate 2 options: to stay on shared lane or to switch to HOV lane, and each option consisted of perception of 10 categories of travel speed distribution of traffic downstream. The calculator should be easily adaptable to use CPT for any other circumstance where applicable.
